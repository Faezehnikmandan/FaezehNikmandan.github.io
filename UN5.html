        Villa in the Woods: 3D Architectural Visualization
    </div>
    <div class="h8 text-center p-5">
        In this project, I designed a modern villa nestled in the heart of a lush, secluded forest. The villa's architecture emphasizes a harmonious blend of contemporary design with the natural landscape surrounding it. For the modeling process, I used Autodesk Revit to meticulously shape every detail, ensuring architectural precision and realism. The scene was then brought to life with Unreal Engine, where I rendered the final visuals, focusing on immersive lighting, rich textures, and atmospheric effects to enhance the woodland setting. <br> This was a personal project created purely for creative exploration and leisure, showcasing the beauty of combining architectural design and advanced rendering technology. Take a look around this tranquil retreat and enjoy the serene atmosphere!
